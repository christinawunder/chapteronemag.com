<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I met Josh in Bogota. Originally from Boston, the 26 year old moved to Colombia two years ago, after having travelled across Latin America. Among his stops were Costa Rica, Mexico, Nicaragua Brazil, Panama.</span></p>
<p><span class="s1">1. Josh, what did you study?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I studied English literature, with minors in Psychology and Spanish. Initially, I didn't know where this combination would bring me. I chose those subjects not because of an endgoal, but rather because I was interested in them. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">2. And what do you do now?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I teach English (Open English) they hire contractirs to teach for them. Verbaling was better, better money (from San Francisco) 15$ an hour for as private lessons 25$</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Last year they stopped.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Some weeks 7 classes a day</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I do it form home Google hangout</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Was a struggle to get here, not sure if I could do it again.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I'm only able to do it because doing it for so long (customers and reviews)</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Verbaling takes commission (like uber for language teaching)</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">No health care - don't get sick.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">?Learned: critical thinking</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">3) Have a lot of freedom. I draw and write and read in free time.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">4) made a lot of money before with verbaling savings</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">5) can't really say that it is. It's why you do. There's   Take it as I go</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">7) worry less about what other people think and how you are perceived. Still struggle with that.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I out a lot of pressure on myself. It has to be perfect. Fear of not having it perfect keeps you from doing it.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Writing </span></p>
