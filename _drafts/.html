<p>Over the last few months I developed a new habit. I started asking my friends and acquaintances the (seemingly) simple question:</p>
<h3>Are you politically active?</h3>
<p>If the answer was no, I wanted to hear their reasons for why not. If the answer was yes, I wanted to find out what they do and how. The answer I got most of the time was:</p>
<h3>"No, I am not."</h3>
<p>Some where quite straight forward: "I just don't have the time."</p>
<p>Others elaborated a bit more: "I mean, I would like to, but to be honest, I don't know how."</p>
<p>"I am quite interested in what is happening in politics. I mean, I vote, I read the news and I have my opinions about things. But I just don't feel like I can have any influence over it, so in a way I give up before trying."</p>
<p>"I was contemplating joining a political party, but it's such a circus in there. They are so busy with themselves that they don't manage to do anything of value."</p>
<p>And I can identify with many of these arguments.</p>
<p>But wait a minute, why would I even ask them these annoying questions? Well, for the same reason I started this blog. I would like to get politically active, but I don't know how I can really make an impact. There are many things I feel strongly about, many issues that I believe need fixing: climate change, growing inequalities, or a range policies that heavily disadvantage future generations.</p>
<p>What can I, of all people, do about it? I mean after all, I am just one person, with no influence, not a lot of money, and with very little time. I am not going to change the world, so...</p>
<h3>Is there even any point in trying?</h3>
<p>What got to me was learning about a thing called generational inequality. Basically it means that the current population of humans lives in a way that is not sustainable, and therefore heavily disadvantages young people, our future children and future generations at large. For example by:</p>
<ul>
<li>destroying the environment and the planet for short-term economic benefits</li>
<li>knowing that current pension systems are not sustainable, but not really doing anything about it</li>
<li>wasting money on poor public management and things that bring short-term gains, while not spending enough in future-oriented investments like education, digital infrastructure or a healthy planet. Because hey, young people are not protesting loud enough, and people who are not born yet cannot protest at all.</li>
<li>[GET MORE AND BETTER EXAMPLES]</li>
</ul>
<p>Wolfgang Gründinger wrote a <a href="https://www.amazon.de/Alte-S%C3%A4cke-Politik-Wie-unsere-Zukunft-verspielen/dp/357908626X">fascinating book about this</a>. If you read German, I do recommend you to check it out.</p>
<p>Today's so-called Millennials (people born between 1980 and 1995) are the first generation, who can expect to be worse off than their parents:</p>
<ul>
<li>They are at higher risk of poverty (in Germany the risk of poverty went <a href="https://www.huffingtonpost.de/entry/generation-loser-armut-millennials-deutschland_de_5b17aa22e4b0734a99391183">up </a><a href="https://www.huffingtonpost.de/entry/generation-loser-armut-millennials-deutschland_de_5b17aa22e4b0734a99391183">from 10% in 1960 </a><a href="https://www.huffingtonpost.de/entry/generation-loser-armut-millennials-deutschland_de_5b17aa22e4b0734a99391183">to over 20% today</a>)</li>
<li>On average, they<a href="http://appsso.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/nui/show.do?query=BOOKMARK_DS-396046_QID_-58EB876F_UID_-3F171EB0&amp;layout=AGE,L,X,0;GEO,L,Y,0;NACE_R2,L,Z,0;ISCO08,L,Z,1;WORKTIME,L,Z,2;TIME,C,Z,3;SEX,L,Z,4;INDIC_SE,L,Z,5;INDICATORS,C,Z,6;&amp;zSelection=DS-396046NACE_R2,B-S_X_O;DS-396046TIME,2010;DS-396046WORKTIME,TOTAL;DS-396046INDICATORS,OBS_FLAG;DS-396046ISCO08,TOTAL;DS-396046INDIC_SE,ERN_MN_EUR;DS-396046SEX,T;&amp;rankName1=INDIC-SE_1_2_-1_2&amp;rankName2=WORKTIME_1_2_-1_2&amp;rankName3=ISCO08_1_2_-1_2&amp;rankName4=INDICATORS_1_2_-1_2&amp;rankName5=SEX_1_2_-1_2&amp;rankName6=NACE-R2_1_2_-1_2&amp;rankName7=TIME_1_0_0_0&amp;rankName8=AGE_1_2_0_0&amp;rankName9=GEO_1_2_0_1&amp;pprRK=FIRST&amp;pprSO=PROTOCOL&amp;ppcRK=FIRST&amp;ppcSO=PROTOCOL&amp;rStp=&amp;cStp=&amp;rDCh=&amp;cDCh=&amp;rDM=true&amp;cDM=true&amp;footnes=false&amp;empty=false&amp;wai=false&amp;time_mode=ROLLING&amp;time_most_recent=true&amp;lang=EN&amp;cfo="> earn less money for the same work</a> (in 1960s Germany, young people entering the job market earned 12% less than older colleagues doing the same job - this inter-generational pay-gap doubled to 25%.

<li>And they can expect to receive less once they retire. (FIND SOURCE)</li>
</ul>
<p>And why is no one doing anything about it? Because this Millennials are virtually nowhere to be seen among the people who make all these policies. How can we expect our interests to be represented, if there is no one representing them?</p>
<p>Young adults under 30 make up around 17% of the population (excluding children), yet less than 2% of parliamentarian representatives are under 30 years old.</p>
<h3>So what can we do to get politically active?</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>From "A Girl's Guide to Joining the Resistance.</p>
<ol>
<li>Start giving a fuck. Check in with your own story.</li>
<li>Find stories and voices that matter. Not only people like you (different races, ages, socio-economic situations)</li>
<li>Take action. Contact representatives. Run for office, volunteer, donate. Have conversations with people that you disagree with. Listen more that you talk. Show up physically for things that matter</li>
<li>Join a group. Think about what you need and want: general brainstorming? Organising around a particular issue? Something else? Go in with a vision, recruit others, Identify other groups you can collaborate with. Have fun doing it.</li>
<li>Be a responsible news consumer. Read widely. Support local news sources. See WHO is talking.</li>
<li>Practice self-care. Saying yes to yourself and your needs makes it easier to say yes to others when the time comes.</li>
</ol>
