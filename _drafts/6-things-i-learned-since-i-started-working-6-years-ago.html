<p>Trying hard is important if you want to achieve something. When I up as a sort-of immigrant in a country, my parents taught me that I always had to work hard, so that I could have it better then them.</p>
<p>But merits, like working hard are not all that matter. As the child of working class people, I was <a href="https://www.zeit.de/2017/42/arbeiterkinder-chancengleichheit-universitaet-minderheit">five times less likely</a> to obtain higher education than if I had been the child of an academic (<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/education/2017/nov/21/english-class-system-shaped-in-schools">for UK figures see here</a>). (some reasons - is there research?)</p>
<p>Since my parents weren't able to support me financially while I invest in my education, it was even less likely that I'd do a Bachelor's and Masters Degree, than if my parents were wealthier.</p>
<p>Once we know that these are the statistics, we can think about whether we think that is good enough or not - and whether we could or should do something to support people who are less off. (first of all for them individually, but also for society as a whole - any research?)</p>
<p>One example of such a support policy is the <a href="https://www.bmbf.de/en/the-german-federal-training-assistance-act-bafog-provides-educational-opportunities-2010.html">German BAFöG.</a></p>
<p>BAFöG is basically a monthly pay check you get from the German government (for Germans but also for EU citizens who have "good prospects of staying in Germany after their education". Half of this pay check is a grant, and the other half is an interest-free loan. Depending on your income and that of your parents, you can receive up to €735 per month to cover your cost of living so that you are able to <a href="https://www.bmbf.de/en/the-german-federal-training-assistance-act-bafog-provides-educational-opportunities-2010.html">"support [yourself] without having to work at all, or only as little as possible, in addition to [your] studies"</a>.</p>
<p>So, back in my day I received around €500 every month for three years during my Bachelor's and €200 during my Master's. I managed to get by.</p>
<p>You don't need statistics to guess that things would have been tougher financially, if I had to find those extra €500 every month. Or if my rent hadn't been much higher than the €200 I paid for my flat-share in my small German university city (never mind London, Paris or Munich).</p>
<p>(But can I find some statistics?)</p>
<p>When I finished my studies, I did what all graduates do: I looked for an internship, a.k.a an underpaid or else unpaid  (it's not 1980 anymore, where you finish school, get a job, and earn a decent living).</p>
<p>Given my age and experience, I would have worked an average of XXXX for free or below minimum wage, before I would have started earning a stable income.</p>
<p>One thing that helped: getting an internship where I earned roughly €1000, which basically covered my rent and food - I got by. This should apply to everyone of XXX thousands of young people doing internships every year (figure??).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Generational pay gap:</p>
<p>Some figures</p>
<p>Why it's important to pay interns and to prevent exploitation (see other drafts)</p>
<p>Important to watch your balance and health, and technology/social media consumption</p>
<p>Make sure to stand up for yourself (salary negotiations or everyday bullshit)</p>
<p>Asking people for advice (mentor?)</p>
<p>Social security: health insurance</p>
<p>non-exploitative employment (deliveroo/uber drivers, parcel delivery)</p>
<p>unemployment benefits</p>
<p>affordable trainings and courses</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>All these things are important, and there are policies here and there. But not enough. It would be great if such policies received more funding, so that more people could pursue higher education, irrespective of whether they parents can afford it or not.</p>
<p>In democratic systems like ours, decisions like that are taken by political candidates we vote for (or don't), and by political parties that we join (or, like <a href="https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitgliederentwicklung_der_deutschen_Parteien">most of us, don't</a>).</p>
<p>Average age over 57, under-representation of young people.</p>
