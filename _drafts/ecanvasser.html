<p>If you were to decide to put yourself forward for an elected office, whether it's for local, regional, national or European elected office, how</p>
<p>Political representatives - as the name suggests - are supposed to represent citizens. But if yo how can you find out what matters to them?</p>
<p>In order to be able to represent them, you have to figure out what is important to them, and build meaningful relationships with them.</p>
<p>Ecanvasser is an app that helps you to organise your campaign, whether you’re running for local, regional, national or European elected office. The team behind Ecanvasser understood one important thing: apps, social networks and the digital sphere in general are tools that can help you connect with the people you want to reach out to.</p>
<p>But ultimately, it’s all about people-to-people contacts, and about moving from wanting to do something to concrete action. So it’s important that debates that are conceived online, actually end up triggering real action offline.</p>
<p>Getting politically involved, starting a movement or even starting to campaign for a concrete political position looks like a huge and somewhat scary task from the outset – mostly, because it simply is.</p>
<p>Ciara, Ecanvasser’s XXX, who I spoke to for this interview, says: “Political campaigning isn’t easy, otherwise everybody would do it, and everybody would win – and that’s just not possible. It’s heavy on resources, it’s time-consuming and it’s just, you know, overall really difficult.” But she is convinced that this should not be a reason to give up before even starting.</p>
<p>Because pretty much any big task seems impossible until it’s done, Ciara suggests to look at getting that kind of movement going, you ought to look at it like at founding a start-up business: “We are seeing a lot more campaigns implementing <a href="#https://www.youtube.com/watch%253Fv=_LTRNt8BHKc">the ‘lean method’, which came from start-ups</a>.” Assuming that political beginners do not have huge resources to draw on, or solid party backing that would ensure you being put on the electoral list and being elected, she explains the different phases and steps of starting a business can be applied to help someone get started from scratch. In this way, not matter the cause, you can turn that big scary task into concrete and achievable steps.</p>
