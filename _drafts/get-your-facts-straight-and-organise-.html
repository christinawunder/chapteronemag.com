<p>What does it take to organise?</p>
<p>Newly-elected congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez calls herself not a politician, but an organiser. Her candidacy gained traction not because she was running on her own behalf, but "because this is a movement".</p>
<p>Black lives matter; Justice Democrats (whose slate she was running on); Brand New Congress; etc.</p>
<p>Sebastian: Grassroots Professionals Network;</p>
<p>The most vulnerable are no longer the elderly, but rather young people and families with children. (<a href="https://www.oecd.org/els/soc/cope-divide-europe-2017-background-report.pdf">OECD</a>Â p.7)</p>
<p>Another noticeable shift that has occurred during the past thirty years pertains to the age profile of poverty, with young people replacing the elderly as the group most at risk of poverty (OECD p.8)</p>
