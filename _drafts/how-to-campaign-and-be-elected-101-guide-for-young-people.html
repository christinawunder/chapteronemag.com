<p>Campaigning: lean (or start-up) method. 9 out of 10 start ups fail.</p>
<p>You don’t win votes by sitting in HQ – you have to meet and talk to people.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li>Build</li>
</ol>
<p>Write down all the issues you want to tackle. Focus on issues close to home first.</p>
<p>Go out and talk to people. See if your thoughts are in line with those of the potential voters</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Measure</li>
</ol>
<p>DATA. See feedback and reactions of electorate.</p>
<p>You may find out that some issues you wanted to tackle affect only you, and no one else cares about it. You may find other issues people care about that you hadn’t thought about.</p>
<p>Documentation: write everything down. It’s a long journey.</p>
<p>3-4 months run-up is the minimum</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>Learn</li>
</ol>
<p>Maybe your assumptions from the start were wrong.</p>
<p>Change the plan.</p>
