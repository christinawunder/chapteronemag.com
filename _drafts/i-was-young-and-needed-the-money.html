<h2>Why my first boss hired me:</h2>
<p>About half a year after I had started my very first real job, this is now 4 years ago, I had a very interesting conversation with my boss at the time. In a personal feedback discussion he explained to me why he had decided to hire me, instead of any of the hundreds of other applicants.</p>
<p>I could make this an article about "how to write a good application letter", but I won't. I want this article to be about something else.</p>
<p>Let's assume that I followed the job applications etiquette manual. I tailored the letter to the company, I more or less understood from the job description what they were looking for, and I presented my skills and competencies in an easy-to-digest manner. And still:</p>
<h2>My application had been discarded in the pre-selection. Sorry, not sorry.</h2>
<p>Because the competing applicants had many years of working experience, and I barely managed to count one and a half (being generous that is, and adding all my internships together).</p>
<p>Luckily, the boss had decided to look through the "No"-pile, where he found my application. He decided to put my application (and a couple of others) back on the "Maybe"-pile. I was back in the race.</p>
<p>He explained to his colleague: "Listen, we're trying to fill a post that has limited contract for one year. You have to consider that nobody, who already has a full-fledged career, will be willing to quit their job and jump into uncertainty, for only one year. That wouldn't be fair."</p>
<p>That is why he decided to give a young person a chance. This reasoning was noble and pragmatic at the same time: of course you could give this job to somebody, who already has lots of experience, but for whom a one-year contract would be a leap into uncertainty, and essentially a step down. This person is likely to become dissatisfied with what we have to offer - and that would be a bad thing for them, as well as for us.</p>
<p>"If, however, we hire someone who is rather unexperienced and young, but all the more motivated and dynamic, it's a win-win-situation for both: we give this person a chance to kick-start their career. For this person, a one-year contract so shortly after graduating university is a jackpot. And a person who is happy and motivated, is very likely to end up doing good work. It's very simple."</p>
<p>I believe that every employer should stop and think about this for a second. Longstanding experience is important, agreed. But it's not everything. <strong>What many forget is that us young people, we are very capable, you know.</strong></p>
<h2>We are educated, curious, motivated and willing to learn.</h2>
<p>All we need is a chance.</p>
<p>My then boss took a risk in hiring me, because not everyone agreed with his approach. "Too junior, too inexperienced, not fit for the job", were the common worries.</p>
<p>But he proved them wrong. I proved them wrong.</p>
