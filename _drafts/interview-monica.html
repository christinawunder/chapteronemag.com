<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Monica, 28, from Bogota</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Team of 5, Crisp is the boss </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">1)What did you study?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Art and design (handcraft and graphic design) to solve human necessity. If you need to sit, you make a chair. If you want to communicate, you make campaigns. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I focuses on sustainable design. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">NGO founded with Likmi "projecto Dominga"</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Want to help people do art and craft without being exploited. Female collective try to connect female communities also in rural areas. Help them to share knowledge and understand that they are similar. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Lived in the Amazon to write thesis. There Likmi was teaching art, and met Dominga. She wanted to see the sea.takin kids from different communities to meet other kids from different territorities to use art as a tool to connect. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In my studies there areTwo ways: wealthy university, so go abroad and do master, connect with art scene (create your own company) or: not so wealthy, you work freelance for bigger companies. Not well paid. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">As young people we always want to go away, but we never focus on our own territories. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We want to help them have a different perspective. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Made a trip with kids from Amazon to Pacific coast on Whale season. Give them experiences thy can change their lives. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Crowdfunding. Artists donated art pieces that were sold, fundraising events</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Of course we struggle with the money. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">2)What is your job now? / how do you make a living?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Try to develop my art. Guiding, manage the tours. My real job is to manage the tour. So if I do what I wanted. Social projects, designing things, projects. But it is not the creative position I was hoping for. I get by, but I'm not where I wanted to be yet. But the dream job when I was studying changed. It built the path to where I am now. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Contemporary society doesn't really define these jobs. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I like Bogota feel whole country</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">70% of population came here from rural areas for a better life</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">100 years 275.000 people living here, now almost 10 mio. So all are second generation immigrants </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">3) what was the most helpful thing that university thought you which is useful for you in life now?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Think, use knowledge. Critical thinking. I am lucky, I went to good university </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Public school and private are very different here. National university is great, but they teach to have employees. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Wealthy class is being taught to develop and improve things. But I struggled with the fact that people were only thinking about money, themselves etc. But not about their community's other people and poor people. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">4) what is the coolest part of your job?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Creating projects and seeing them come true </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">5) what motivates you to keep going when things get more difficult?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I am stubborn, so I don't give up </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">6) if you can pick a dream: where would you like to see yourself in 5 years? / Bogota graffiti scene in 5 years? </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Would love to be selling my designs and have exhibitions, but keep working on social projects, cultural management, so giving opportunities to children and community </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">7) tips recommendation to your younger self? </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Keep focussed. I am not constant. I have skills that I don't exploit to the max because of lack of discipline. Being an artist requires discipline. Not having a formal job has advantages and disadvantages. You can waste your time if you don't have fixed hours. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Josh, from Boston</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">1) studies English literature, psychology Spanish </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">2) now I teach English (Open English) they hire contractirs to teach for them. Verbaling was better, better money (from San Francisco) 15$ an hour for as private lessons 25$</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Last year they stopped. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Some weeks 7 classes a day </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I do it form home Google hangout </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Was a struggle to get here, not sure if I could do it again. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I'm only able to do it because doing it for so long (customers and reviews) </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Costa Rica, Mexico, Costa Rica Nicaragua Brazil panama here. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Verbaling takes commission (like uber for language teaching)</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">No health care - don't get sick. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">?Learned: critical thinking </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">3) Have a lot of freedom. I draw and write and read in free time. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">4) made a lot of money before with verbaling savings </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">5) can't really say that it is. It's why you do. There's   Take it as I go</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">7) worry less about what other people think and how you are perceived. Still struggle with that. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I out a lot of pressure on myself. It has to be perfect. Fear of not having it perfect keeps you from doing it. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Writing </span></p>
<p class="p1">
