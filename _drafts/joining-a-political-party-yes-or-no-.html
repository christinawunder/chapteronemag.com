<p>Extracts from <a href="#https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fPTg5tP5QJc">Video on party membership</a>:</p>
<p>“A few generations ago, around 10-12% of the general population were members of a political party. Nowadays, the average in Europe is about 5%, in the majority of countries, it’s actually less than that, hovering at around 3-4% – which is effectively nobody. […] Party membership is supposed to be representative of the general public. And that patently isn’t the case anymore.” What’s the purpose of political party membership?</p>
<p>“People are still engaged in politics, they are just engaged in a different way. […] The ties between people and parties have gotten looser. And the political parties don’t seem to care about that too much.”</p>
<p>Brand building for parties? The rules of engagement (and the way in which parties chose to reach out) have changed.</p>
<p>Left: “The brand approach is absolutely the wrong way to go about it, because brands come and go. Parties are often very focused on one single leader. Long-term party membership is where they should be building. Because people who are passionate  about your policy platform will stay with your party through the bad times as well as the good.”</p>
<p>Right: “In my opinion political parties are missing a major point if they collapse towards social media marketing only, and leave their membership wither on the vine.” Parties should be a tool “for the voters, as opposed to just going to the ballot box once every five years. Whereas if you actually become a member of the party, you get to decide who those candidates are going to be or what the manifesto is going to be. This way, you increase your democratic representation 10x by being a party member. This is something that people don’t get otherwise, so this is something I feel that political parties could offer to the general public a bit more.”</p>
<p>So much for the theory. But the problem seems to be that LEFT: “Most political parties are very vertical these days. Power is centralises at the head office, and they have fallen out of touch with their local membership”, meaning that as a regular party member, you end up getting to influence a whole lot – not a very good deal after all.</p>
<p>“Grass root building is key”, in order for that to happen.</p>

<p>Gespräch mit Simone:</p>
<p>My granddad worked in the steel industry. He knew: I am a worker, I vote for the workers party. Because they are the ones that are watching out for me. His employer was "the middle class". He voted for the conservative party, because they were watching out for him.</p>
<p>Today, it is not that simple anymore.</p>
<p>Today, you have a single mum, who is working too long hours for too little money, to support her children and manage to fill the fridge on a regular basis. She is struggling, and the only ones who are promising to watch out for her, are the populists. Because they are saying the things that nobody else is daring to say: that something is going wrong, big time. So she votes for them, thinking they will be able to improve things for her.</p>
<p>The only problem is this: they won't.</p>
<p>Because the only things that populists have to offer, is manifestos of what they are <em><strong>against</strong></em>. They hardly ever state what they are <em><strong>for</strong></em>, they hardly ever offer solutions.</p>
<p>No, to the contrary. Instead of working the problems that we really should be solving (climate change, fair taxation, etc.), they are pitting the people at the bottom of society against each other. Because if the poor, financially unstable single mum is hating on the poor vulnerable immigrant, that's the best possible deal for the populist, because it diverts the attention from what he is actually offering.</p>
<p>The only way to fix our democracy in my opinion, is to make sure the political system represents the people - both in terms of gender, age, as well as socio-economic background.</p>
