<p>My friend said to me the other day: "It's been 10 years since my Erasmus year in university, and we're getting together for a reunion this weekend. I'm really excited, because my Erasmus-year was a very special experience, I guess it has shaped me in a way."</p>
<h3>Going abroad shaped my life and views</h3>
<p>I could relate to her words. It reminded me of the first time I went abroad. Ten years ago - it was just weeks after I finished high school - I moved to England. I had just turned 19, and gotten a job to teach German at a school in England. I ended up staying for a year and a half, and that time has definitely shaped me, my personal development and career path.</p>
<p>I then went on to study translation and interpreting at a University in Germany. Our faculty was located outside of the city, in a little town in the German Rhine valley, known for not much more than its traditions of Karneval and wine making. The students there came from <a href="https://www.mz-web.de/leben/germersheim--die-sprachen-metropole-in-der-pfalz-7245278">70 different countries</a>, and almost half of the students came from all over the world.</p>
<h3>I could go abroad it even though my parents aren't rich</h3>
<p>Like most of my friends, I then did Erasmus. What was so great about it, was that I didn't have to find the money for it from my parents - they wouldn't have had that kind of money either.</p>
<p>But I didn't need rich parents to pay for it - the European Union was kindly taking care of that.</p>
<p>All I had to do was study and enjoy.</p>
<h3>Should the EU spend money on helping you to travel?</h3>
<p>I say: Yes.</p>
<p>By meeting amazing new people from lots of different backgrounds and cultures, I generally learned to at accept the idea that what is "the normal" for me, might not be "the normal" for everybody.</p>
<p>It is good to learn that your world views are not universal. That there are many different kinds of people, cultures and religions, and that there is no threat in that - on the contrary, it is great to make new friends.</p>
<p>For lack of a better word, it helps broaden your horizon, and that is a good thing. It's not only fun, it is part of your life education. And as such, it should be accessible to all.</p>
<p>Travelling abroad not only changed my views on the world. Paired with my inherent nerd-ness and a bit of serendipity, it also significantly shaped my career path. I went from being the first in my extended family to ever go to university, to speaking 4 languages and working in the EU.</p>
<h3>This is where it gets political, but bear with me:</h3>
<p>Wouldn't it be cool for all young people to benefit from that experience, no matter whether they're parents can afford it, or whether they go to university?</p>
<p>Irrespective of whether they later become economists, nurses or kindergarden teachers? Before they choose their future career path? For example, when they are 18?</p>
<p>That's what the EU had in mind, when they decided to hand out travel vouchers to 25,000 people aged 18, so they can travel up to 30 days across Europe.</p>
<p>True, travelling for 30 days is not the same as living somewhere during a whole Erasmus year. Also the whole application process <a href="https://europa.eu/youth/discovereu_en">for this programme is still a bit complicated</a>, but it's a good first step. We should now put some thought into how to improve and expand these support programmes.</p>
<h3>More support for young people...</h3>
<p>As the EU is currently discussing its <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/future-europe/eu-budget-future_en">future budget</a> for after 2020, I would hope that they include more programmes like this in their budget planning.</p>
<p>I would hope that the Parliament insists on strengthening such programmes, and I would want the governments in the European member states agree to provide the funding for them, because in my opinion, this is exactly the type of things we should invest our money in.</p>
<p>For that to happen, I have to rely on the people in governments and parliaments to know what I want and relate to my problems.</p>
<h3>...through more young people in politics</h3>
<p>As the average politician in Europe is about 53 years old, I'm sure they could use the second pair of eyes from those, who know what challenges young people have, and who know exactly what kind of support they would have appreciated, just 5 or 10 years ago - or now.</p>
<p>Travel programmes are one example, but we should also do more to support young people getting into politics - from mentoring, training or to access to networks, or concrete campaigning support for independent candidates.</p>
<h3>Why should young people be supported to enter politics?</h3>
<p>Young people are chronically <a href="https://www.un.org/youthenvoy/2016/03/ipu-report-reveals-chronic-representation-young-people-worlds-parliaments/">underrepresented in politics</a>. People under 30 make up 17% of the population (that excludes children). Yet, they provide less than 2% of all members of parliament, and rarely carry high political roles (even though lately we have seen a <a href="https://www.politico.eu/interactive/europe-youth-wave/">slight trend to the opposite</a>, with in some cases questionable effects).</p>
<p>If we want to make sure that a generational shift in politics is not overtaken by populists or isolationists, we should be giving much more young people the chance to develop an open mindset and support their political engagement in as many ways we can, until they are equally and diversely represented at the table.</p>
<h3>Why should we should support diversity</h3>
<p>You can't fix what you don't know is broken. An all male-team won't know how something affects women and vice-versa. Just like person without disability won't know how to make something accessible for people with certain challenges, unless they have someone on the team who does. And you can't know whether a social policy is working in certain parts of society, if you don't have any of them sitting in your own ranks to tell you.</p>
<p>Once they do, institutions and governments can become better at reflecting the needs of not only some, but of all.</p>
