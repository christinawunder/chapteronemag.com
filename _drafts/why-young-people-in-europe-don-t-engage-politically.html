<h2>Not knowing how to do something is the biggest turn-off</h2>
<p>Have you ever asked yourself why you procrastinate on stuff? I mean, sure, it could be just plain laziness, but let's be honest, a lot of the times there are other reasons why we avoid the things that we should be doing. Maybe the task at hand so boring and useless that you cannot bring yourself to do it (in these cases it may be wise try and get rid of the obligation all together).</p>
<p>For me, the number one reason for procrastination is that I just don't know HOW to do it. No matter how important and potentially rewarding it would be to get cracking at it, not knowing where even to begin can sometimes make the task so daunting that I try to avoid it at all cost.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Studies show that the current "millennial" generation, i.e. people born between 1980 and 1995, are more interested in politics than previous generations. However, they are less interested in party politics. They don't see how they could possibly have an impact on what those guys there are doing.</p>
<p>Here's what's wrong with political parties:</p>
<p>hierarchical</p>
<p>location-oriented</p>
<p>complicated structures, little online-engagement</p>
<p>little possibilities to shape the content (no one wants to just subscribe to something "they up there" are saying and doing - I want to leave a mark!)</p>
<p>Survey (67 young people active in German local politics) <a href="https://www.ardmediathek.de/tv/Lokalzeit-aus-Dortmund/Neue-Wege-f%C3%BCr-Nachwuchs-Politiker/WDR-Fernsehen/Video?bcastId=7293572&amp;documentId=56541282">What should be done to facilitate young people's engagement in political parties?</a></p>
<ol>
<li>more active recruitment and advertising in schools/university</li>
<li>more support by the parties themselves</li>
<li>better pay</li>
</ol>
<p>But what else? This work is very time and energy consuming. The meeting times are often difficult for people who work, let alone those who have families. Committee meetings at 14:30? How am I going to explain that to my boss? In Germany, employers are obliged to grant you some leave for political work, but not paid leave. Now that is a very real problem, assuming you are working to pay your rent and food - not just for fun and self-fulfilment.</p>
<p>Most young people engaged in political parties agree: the structures in these parties have to adapt to the realities of young people.</p>
<p>The focus shouldn't be solely about long-term membership and track-record of time spent in various meetings and more about substance. Parties should allow its members to participate on an issue-by-issue basis.</p>
<p>Many young party members are asking for live-streams into committee meetings or virtual video-conferences that could be followed from anywhere. This doesn't seem like a big ask, but this is met with a great degree of resistance by their older counterparts. "Face-to-face meetings are still the best option" or "this is not ideal for communication" are some of their arguments.</p>
<p>Let's be clear: Yes, real-life meetings are better than virtual ones, agreed - but what if too much rigidity outright excludes certain groups of people all together? Making it possible only for pensioners to attend political meetings cannot be the point of inclusive policy making at local level (or at any level for that matter). Not all types of events and meetings are suitable for this kind of virtual tools. But where they are, they could be applied. The same goes for concrete work on position papers or policy drafts. While in some cases it could be better to meet and discuss in person, many other occasions will be served best with a google-document, on which members work on remotely.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But let's zoom in on that second point: more support by the very political party that these young people are expected to devote to.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Why be engaged?</p>
<ol>
<li>Altruism/to help, to create change/have an impact</li>
<li>learning/skills/career/network</li>
<li>social factor: doing things with others</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Fine, I would like to do something - but how?</h2>
<ol>
<li>Voting (too little)</li>
<li>Running for office (too much - also we would have to decide for a party, which, let's face it, for millennials is hard to do.)</li>
</ol>
<h2>Is there no middle ground?</h2>
<p>Yes, there certainly is. It doesn't even have to be politics.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Options Guide</strong></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. What do you care about? PICK YOUR BATTLE</p>
<p>As much as we'd like to, we can't fix everything.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Politics or volunteering? This is an important one.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. What are you good at, what are your skills?</p>
<p>writing a business plan, drafting a press release or running a social media campaign</p>
<p>In my family everyone has a job. My dad fixes stuff. My mum helps with accounting. My sister administers all things medical. My grandma tends to the garden. And I pick fights  ? Talk smart and get admin stuff done ?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3. How much time can you commit? How involved do you want to be?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>4. What is suitable to fix the issue? How big is it? Can an awareness campaign solve it? Do you need to join a bigger organisation? Do you need to convince a certain politician?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Diverse teams</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Goal: what would you like to achieve? What do you want to read as a headline in 5 years?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What theory of change? E.g. reputation damage, targeting undecided voters, etc</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A democracy relies on a certain percentage of its population to engage. Through electing, through participating in parties, through voicing their concerns and preferences.</p>
<p>If no one cares, the political representatives are not legitimate.</p>
<p>Being unhappy with ones political representatives - or as some would call it: elites - can lead to two things:</p>
<p>1. engaging in order to change, if one has the feeling that he or she <em>can</em> actually change something</p>
<p>2. or disengaging, if one feels like he or she has <em>no influence what so ever</em> over the way things will play out.</p>
