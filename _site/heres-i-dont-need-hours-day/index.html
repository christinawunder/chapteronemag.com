<meta name="description" content="It is such a tempting thought, isn&#39;t it: if only we had a few more hours in the day. Just three additional hours every day, and I would be doing all the beautiful things that I never get to find the time for, like sleeping in, relaxing, calling my granny. Instead I am chasing deadlines, appointments and drinks, without ever getting anywhere near the end of that to-do-list. Without ever fully recovering from all the activities or advancing with that project I have been wanting to do since forever. But when I pause for just a second, I realise: actually, that&#39;s bullshit. Does more time automatically lead to more relaxation? I mean, really, think about it: Thank God that our day doesn&#39;t have more that those 24 hours. Otherwise this constant chasing of to-dos would never stop. The thought that a few additional hours in the day would automatically lead to more relaxation and tranquility is just as unrealistic as me suddenly managing to eat &quot;just that tiny peace of chocolate and leaving the rest of the bar for tomorrow&quot;, haha. The only thing that would happen, if I had three more hours in the day, is that I would try to squeeze even more tasks into my agenda; tasks, that I would, again, never ever take the time to recover from. After having finished my fairly exhausting masters degree (studying full-time, working in an unpaid internship on the sides, as well as waiting tables at the weekends to actually earn some money), I really enjoyed all that newly found free time when I started working &quot;only&quot; 40 hours a week. What a luxury, to finally be able to read normal books after work (and scrapping all that annoying scientific literature). To finally be able to exercise, to meet friends, to binge-watch TV-series - in short: for having free weekends without the pressure of having to study, to do, to be efficient. Well, in my new job I work more like 60-70 hours a week. But still - even when you deduct sleeping - aren&#39;t there another 50 hours or so left for all those nice activities every week? Now, three years after graduating, I have once again reached the limits of my time credit. Don&#39;t get me wrong, I love my job (otherwise I wouldn&#39;t be investing all that time and energy); I love my side projects and spending time with my friends in the countless bars and even more countless networking events this city has to offer. But what I have come to realise is that, inevitably, there comes a moment when you have to learn to say No. To miss out on certain things. To leave a task unfinished every once in a while, if it&#39;s not a life or death situation. When exactly that moment comes, that&#39;s a completely individual story. I still haven&#39;t really found mine. ...or would more time just mean more work? However, one thing is certain: if I had three more hours every day - like people tend to wish for when making conversation - maybe I would even use it to relax during the first days and weeks. That&#39;s a big maybe. But eventually, wouldn&#39;t there be a time, when (without even noticing) I would again fill every last minute of my spare time with stuff to do instead of using it for all the wonderful things that I initially wanted to be doing? And what then? Demand another three hours from the time-fairy, which I, again, would not use for relaxing activities? What was slightly comforting, however, was realising that I am not alone with this problem, when I attended the first TedxBrusselsWomen-talks last week. It gathered lots of interesting speakers under the theme &quot;It&#39;s about time&quot;, which shared there their thoughts and experiences with us. In a short film produced for these Tedx-talks, award-winning producer Grace Lee has interviewed several women about what they would do with a few extra hours in the day. The answers were as witty as they were honest and true: &quot;I know I should be saying that I would do exercise, sleep, take a bath or read a book. But I would probably just try to get more work done.&quot; No, that doesn&#39;t seem right. I don&#39;t need more time, I only need the courage to simply do less every now and again. The first step in getting there (okay, it&#39;s actually two steps) is: prioritising and saying No. Prioritising and saying No - how do you do that? Well, that&#39;s super easy - said no one ever. If I ever find out how to do that, you&#39;ll be the first to find out. Until then, please do feel free to throw your recommendations at me." />
