<h1>Welcome to Chapter One Mag - The Archive</h1>

This blog was a project by Christina Wunder between 2014 and 2019.

Back in 2014, I started this project as a blog by and for young professionals. I wanted to create the kind of resource I would have needed when starting my career. Together with many other community authors I wrote about topics like: how to search for jobs, how to make the most of them, or how to identify and develop your personal and professional skills.

At that time, the blog was operated in German, and most of these articles are available here.

Another topic discussed on this blog were options for political action that young people have at their disposal. It looked at how young people can have an impact on current societal and global challenges â€“ whether through active participation in politics, through civic engagement or activism.

I have since stopped maintaining this blog, and it is now archived here.

If you would like to follow my current projects, feel free to get in touch on LinkedIn <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/christinawunder/"></a> or Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/christinawunder"></a>.
